# jekyll.js

jekyll addon that uses github personal access tokens to publish from
website.

### Personal access tokens

They can be generated from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Remember to give READ/WRITE permissions to token.

### Installation

You can simply add the git repo as a submodule in your jekyll post.
Alternatively you can also use the editor at [georoot.github.io](https://georoot.github.io/jekyll.js/). Because the `personal tokens` are only saved on local browser, make sure to logout if you are working on a not personal system.

To add as a submodule on existing jekyll blog

```
git submodule add https://github.com/georoot/jekyll.js admin
```

and then you can simply visit `<username>.github.io/admin` to access
the editor.
